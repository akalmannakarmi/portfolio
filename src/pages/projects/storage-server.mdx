      Storage Server is a Flask-based application that acts as a lightweight personal file server. It allows uploading, organizing, listing, and downloading files through a simple web interface — essentially working like a mini NAS (Network-Attached Storage) solution for personal use.

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-pandaBrown/90 mb-6">
      <li>📂 Upload and manage files directly from the browser</li>
      <li>🌳 Displays files and directories in a tree structure</li>
      <li>🖼️ Supports inline viewing of images and media</li>
      <li>💾 Stores metadata in SQLite for quick lookups</li>
      <li>⚙️ Built with Flask, using JSON for lightweight configuration</li>
      <li>🖥️ Runs locally as a private NAS on a secondary device</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="text-pandaBrown">
      This project started as a personal utility to manage files between devices and evolved into a flexible self-hosted storage app using Flask and SQLite.

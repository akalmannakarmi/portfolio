      The Lease Management System was developed for <strong>Karmachari Sanchaya Kosh (Employees Provident Fund – EPF)</strong> to streamline the handling of land, building, and hoarding board leases.
      It provides accounting tools such as ledgers, bills, tax and penalty calculation, and automated report generation.
    </p>

    <p class="text-pandaBrown mb-6">
      Built with <strong>Django REST Framework</strong> and <strong>PostgreSQL</strong>, the system was deployed on an <strong>Oracle</strong> database for production.
      It generates reports in CSV, PDF, and HTML formats, providing users with flexibility and accessibility in their workflows.
    </p>

    <p class="text-pandaBrown mb-6">
      This project was developed collaboratively by a team of two interns, one mid-level developer, and myself as a Django developer. 
      My contributions focused on API design, accounting logic implementation, and report generation.
    </p>

    <p class="text-pandaBrown mb-6">
      Working on this project helped me learn how to generate structured CSV and HTML reports and deepen my understanding of accounting logic and terminology I had learned in college.

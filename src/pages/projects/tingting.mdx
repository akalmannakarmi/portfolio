    <p class="text-pandaBrown mb-6">
      <strong>TingTing</strong> is a telemarketing application that uses text-to-voice technology for communication in low-resource languages, focusing on <strong>Nepali</strong>. 
      The platform enables automated SMS and voice campaigns powered by text-to-speech AI, supporting businesses in customer outreach and engagement.
    </p>

    <p class="text-pandaBrown mb-6">
      I contributed as a <strong>Django Developer</strong> (with full-stack involvement) in a team consisting of a senior full-stack developer, a mid-level Django developer, 
      one Django trainee, and a React frontend developer. My responsibilities included integrating payment systems like <strong>Khalti</strong> and <strong>eSewa</strong> 
      with a credit-based billing system for both SMS and phone services, implementing campaign report generation, and designing a custom text editor using <strong>Draft.js</strong> 
      for seamless translation and tag management.
    </p>

    <p class="text-pandaBrown mb-6">
      I also implemented an auditing system to track all user actions, migrated data from the old TingTing version, and optimized call callback processing — 
      reducing CPU usage from 100% to around 20%, enabling far more concurrent calls.
    </p>

    <p class="text-pandaBrown mb-6">
      Beyond the main system, I developed a standalone <strong>Python package</strong> to interact with the TingTing API, allowing developers and external systems 
      to programmatically send messages, manage campaigns, and retrieve reports with ease. This modular approach improved maintainability and simplified API integration for future projects.
    </p>

    <p class="text-pandaBrown mb-6">
      Built with <strong>Django REST Framework</strong>, <strong>Celery</strong>, <strong>Redis</strong>, and <strong>PostgreSQL</strong> on the backend, 
      and <strong>Next.js</strong>, <strong>React</strong>, and <strong>TanStack Query</strong> on the frontend, TingTing represents a high-performance, 
      large-scale communication platform built for automation and reliability.
    </p>

    <p class="text-pandaBrown mb-6">
      This was my most extensive project at Prixa, where I learned to work effectively within a large, structured team, 
      collaborate closely with senior engineers, and contribute meaningfully across multiple layers of a complex software system.

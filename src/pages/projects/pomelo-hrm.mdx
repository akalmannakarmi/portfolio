      <strong>Pomelo HRM</strong> by Prixa Technologies is a comprehensive human resource management platform designed for businesses of all sizes. 
      It supports multi-tenant architecture and provides a wide range of HR features including employee profile management, leave requests, and performance tracking.
    </p>

    <p class="text-pandaBrown mb-6">
      The system includes modules for attendance records, upcoming birthday reminders, and company announcements — helping organizations streamline their HR operations efficiently.
    </p>

    <p class="text-pandaBrown mb-6">
      Built using <strong>Django</strong> with <strong>Django REST Framework</strong> for APIs, <strong>Celery</strong> and <strong>Redis</strong> for task management, 
      and <strong>PostgreSQL</strong> for database handling. The mobile version of Pomelo HRM was developed using <strong>Flutter</strong>.
    </p>

    <p class="text-pandaBrown mb-6">
      I contributed to maintaining the existing system, debugging legacy issues, and improving overall platform stability. 
      This project gave me valuable experience working with large-scale multi-tenant systems and learning how enterprise-level HR tools are maintained and evolved over time.

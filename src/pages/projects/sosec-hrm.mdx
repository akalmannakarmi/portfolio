    <p class="text-pandaBrown mb-6">
      <strong>Sosec HRM</strong> is a customized fork of Pomelo HRM, developed for <strong>SOSEC Nepal</strong> to address their specific organizational needs.
      It extends the core HRM functionalities with additional modules like travel management, timesheets, and enhanced leave and recommendation workflows.
    </p>

    <p class="text-pandaBrown mb-6">
      Built with <strong>Django Templates</strong> and <strong>Django REST Framework</strong> on the backend, using <strong>PostgreSQL</strong> for database management, 
      and <strong>Flutter</strong> for the mobile application, Sosec HRM provides a robust system for managing staff activities and approvals efficiently.
    </p>

    <p class="text-pandaBrown mb-6">
      I contributed to maintaining the system and implementing new features such as the leave and travel recommendation logic, recommender-approver workflows, 
      and timesheet management. The project was developed collaboratively with one intern, with me leading as the Django developer in charge.
    </p>

    <p class="text-pandaBrown mb-6">
      This project taught me how to take ownership of development responsibilities, lead a small team, and mentor interns while enhancing my understanding 
      of enterprise-level HRM systems and workflow automation.

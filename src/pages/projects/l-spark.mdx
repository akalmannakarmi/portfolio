      <strong>L-Spark Fire and Safety</strong> is a corporate website built to provide comprehensive information about the company’s fire protection and safety services. 
      The platform highlights the company’s expertise in fire equipment installation, fire safety management, emergency evacuation planning, and training programs.
    </p>

    <p class="text-pandaBrown mb-6">
      Developed using <strong>Django Templates</strong> and <strong>PostgreSQL</strong>, the system enables dynamic content management for sections like Vision, Mission, and Service details, 
      ensuring an easily maintainable and scalable site for the client.
    </p>

    <p class="text-pandaBrown mb-6">
      I contributed as a <strong>Django trainee</strong>, collaborating with three mid-level Django developers and one other trainee. 
      My primary role involved refining templates and implementing layout fixes to maintain visual consistency and responsiveness across pages.
    </p>

    <p class="text-pandaBrown mb-6">
      Working on L-Spark helped me understand production-level Django template workflows, collaborative development practices, and how small design improvements can enhance user experience on professional CMS platforms.

      Bytewalk is a CMS website developed for a software studio with a team of 10+ technologists dedicated to transforming businesses through technology. 
      The platform was built using Django Templates and CKEditor for easy content management and customization.
    </p>

    <p class="text-pandaBrown mb-6">
      I contributed to creating and customizing various sections of the site and implementing content toggling functionalities. 
      This project was built collaboratively with a team of two interns, one mid-level Django developer, and one frontend developer.
    </p>

    <p class="text-pandaBrown mb-6">
      Working on Bytewalk was my first professional project at Prixa. I learned how CMS systems are structured, how Django works in real-world projects, 
      and the importance of teamwork and task division in collaborative development.

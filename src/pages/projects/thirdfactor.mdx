      <strong>ThirdFactor</strong> is a dashboard application built for analyzing and visualizing KYC verification data for over 100,000 Khalti users. 
      It provides detailed insights into the verification process through charts and breakdowns by status, helping operators monitor and improve verification efficiency.
    </p>

    <p class="text-pandaBrown mb-6">
      Developed with <strong>Django templating</strong> and <strong>Chart.js</strong>, the system aggregates KYC data and presents it through interactive graphs and dynamic filters 
      such as date ranges, search functionality, and detailed record views.
    </p>

    <p class="text-pandaBrown mb-6">
      I contributed to building the dashboard views and chart visualizations, implementing optimized database queries to handle large datasets efficiently. 
      The project was developed in collaboration with one frontend developer and one mid-level Django developer, with me serving as the Django developer responsible for backend logic and data presentation.
    </p>

    <p class="text-pandaBrown mb-6">
      Working on ThirdFactor helped me understand database query optimization, data aggregation for analytics, and the importance of handling memory and performance constraints when dealing with high-volume data.

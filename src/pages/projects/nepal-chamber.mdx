      The Nepal Chamber of Commerce (NCC), established in 1952 (2007 BS), is the first Chamber of Commerce in Nepal with over 1,600 ordinary members and 8,000 registered firms.
      The website serves as a comprehensive CMS platform allowing administrators to manage chambers, committees, executives, and members.
    </p>

    <p class="text-pandaBrown mb-6">
      Built using Django templating, PostgreSQL, and CKEditor, the system provides dynamic content management capabilities for key sections like the President’s Message, Executives, Committees, and Membership details.
    </p>

    <p class="text-pandaBrown mb-6">
      I contributed to implementing many of the CMS features, helping structure and customize core functionalities for content management. 
      This project was developed collaboratively with a team of two interns, two mid-level Django developers, and one frontend developer, while I was serving as a Django intern.
    </p>

    <p class="text-pandaBrown mb-6">
      Working on the Nepal Chamber of Commerce website helped me gain a deeper understanding of Django’s core features, CMS development, and the collaborative process in real-world production environments.

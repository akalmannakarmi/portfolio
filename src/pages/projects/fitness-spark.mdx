      <strong>Fitness Spark</strong> is a full-stack web application where users can create personalized meal plans and explore a large collection of recipes.
      It was developed as my <strong>BCA 6th semester</strong> project in collaboration with <a href="https://sanixport.netlify.app" target="_blank" class="text-pandaRed underline">Sanish Maharjan</a>.
    </p>

    <p class="text-pandaBrown mb-6">
      The app allows users to search for recipes, view nutritional details, and build meal plans tailored to their dietary preferences.
      Recipes can be filtered and organized efficiently, providing a clean and intuitive user experience for health and fitness tracking.
    </p>

    <p class="text-pandaBrown mb-6">
      Built with <strong>FastAPI</strong> for the backend and <strong>MongoDB</strong> for data storage, the project uses <strong>React</strong> and <strong>Next.js</strong> for the frontend,
      ensuring a fast and modern user interface with seamless page transitions.
    </p>

    <p class="text-pandaBrown mb-6">
      This project helped me gain deeper experience in full-stack web development, API design, and working with NoSQL databases. 
      It also gave me hands-on experience in collaborative development and deployment of production-ready applications.

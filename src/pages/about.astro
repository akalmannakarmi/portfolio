    <h1 class="text-4xl font-heading text-pandaRed mb-6">🐾 About Me</h1>

    <p class="text-lg mb-4">
      Hey, I’m <span class="font-semibold text-pandaRed">Akal Man Nakarmi</span> — a full-stack developer who codes like a red panda:
      curious, calm, and a little obsessed with efficiency. I love creating systems that are simple,
      fast, and reliable — the kind that just work without unnecessary fluff.
    </p>

    <p class="text-lg mb-4">
      My coding journey started back in school with <span class="font-semibold">QBASIC</span>, which first introduced me
      to programming logic and sparked my curiosity. Not long after, I picked up
      <span class="font-semibold">Python</span> and built a small Snake game — the first time I saw something I made
      actually come alive on screen. That moment lit a spark that never went out — I went from Python scripts and Flask
      experiments to full-blown <span class="font-semibold">Django</span> apps and <span class="font-semibold">Next.js</span> frontends.
    </p>

    <p class="text-lg mb-4">
      I previously worked as a <span class="font-semibold">Django Developer</span> at
      <span class="font-semibold">Prixa Technologies</span>, contributing to large-scale systems in HRM, finance, and
      communication. It gave me real-world experience with <span class="font-semibold">scalable architectures</span>,
      <span class="font-semibold">API design</span>, and <span class="font-semibold">frontend development</span> using
      React and Next.js. It also taught me the value of writing maintainable code that can adapt and evolve with time.
    </p>

    <p class="text-lg mb-4">
      After leaving Prixa, I took a break to focus on personal projects and self-learning — diving deep into
      <span class="font-semibold">automation</span>, <span class="font-semibold">Boto3</span>,
      <span class="font-semibold">Cloudflare</span>, and <span class="font-semibold">Linux customization</span>
      (my Arch setup is my happy place 🐧). Lately, I’ve been building small tools, automating workflows, and exploring
      low-level languages like <span class="font-semibold">Zig</span> and <span class="font-semibold">Rust</span>,
      just to see how far I can push minimalism.
    </p>

    <p class="text-lg mb-8">
      I believe good software should be <span class="font-semibold">lightweight, transparent, and honest</span> —
      like a well-tuned instrument or, you know, a panda quietly balancing on a branch. That’s the energy I try to bring
      into every project — calm, curious, and always improving.
    </p>
